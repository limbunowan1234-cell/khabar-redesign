// lib/adConfig.ts
// Ad placements config. `active: false` on a placement is the master
// kill switch -- AdSlot.tsx refuses to render anything for a campaign
// unless this AND the D1 ad_campaigns row (see cloudflare/src/routes/
// ads.ts) both say active.
//
// Nothing is running right now. The two in-house community appeals that
// used these slots -- Bring Anmol Home (hero banner) and the Raunak
// fundraiser (sidebar) -- ended on 30 Oct 2026: `active: false` below and
// `active = 0` on their D1 ad_campaigns rows. Their pages stay up so links
// people already shared keep working. To reuse a slot, point it at a new
// campaign and flip both flags back on.
//
// The earlier campaign this system was built for (Subha Enterprise
// Consultant LLP, Russia warehouse jobs) was removed: eMigrate's own
// Recruiting Agent registry (the legal requirement under the Emigration
// Act, 1983 to recruit Indians for overseas jobs) has no record of them,
// and their listed website doesn't resolve. Any future third-party
// advertiser goes through the same steps: add an entry to AD_PLACEMENTS,
// insert its D1 ad_campaigns row, flip both `active` flags once verified.
//
// Two homepage slots are wired up in app/HomeClient.tsx:
// homepageHeroBanner, homepageSidebar. This site also has no "jobs"
// section, so a jobsFeaturedCard/jobsGridCard/jobsSectionBanner-style
// placement would need a page to live on first -- a separate product
// decision this file doesn't make on its own.
